# Love Beer
  An app for sharing your favorite beers.  Upvote the ones you like, and downvote the ones you don't!  

# React/Redux Front-end Implementation with a Rails 5 API Backend
  React makes this app snappy, React Router provides RESTful routing, and the beers are safe and sound in a Rails 5 API backend, served to the front via JSON format.

# Usage
  To use, copy repo and run `bundle install` and `npm install`.  After that, `rake start` will fire up the backend server on localhost:3001 while the app runs on localhost:3000.

# API
  New to the app is a JSON API backend.  API endpoints render JSON.  Beers are all available on the API, indexed or individual show.  For example, to view the beers index, click on `All Beers`.
